# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** This pack supports two execution paths. Use `pane-driven-development` for fresh-pane-per-task execution with task review and final review (the default, e.g. via `/execute`). Use this skill for inline, single-session sequential execution with checkpoints — the fallback when `HERDR_ENV` is unset or no idle sibling agent pane exists. Both still require the review gate before merge.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. If a codegraph plugin/tool is available, validate the plan's named files, symbols, dependencies, and likely impact surface with codegraph search/callers/callees/impact. If unavailable, validate with ordinary repo search and file reads.
3. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
4. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
5. If no concerns: Create todos for the plan items and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - Ensures isolated workspace (creates one or verifies existing)
- **writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks
